      Action the program takes. If there is an error, the program will
      exit with EXIT_FAILURE (see below for numeric exit codes).

      add - Ensure that a sources.list entry conforming to the
      specification is present.

      apply-template - Ensures that all sources.list entries mandated by
      the given APT template are present and enabled. Use --template to
      pass in the template name.

      disable - Find existing entries matching the filter specification,
      and ensure they're disabled (commented out).

      enable - Find existing entries matching the filter specification,
      and ensure they're enabled (not commented out).

      find - Print all sources.list entries matching the filter
      specification to stdout. If no match is found and there was no
      general error, exists with EXIT_NOMATCH.

      remove - Remove all sources.list entries matching the filter
      specification. If any matching entry resides in a file with other
      entries, the entry won't get removed but disabled instead.

      EXIT STATUS CODES: 0 - no error (EXIT_SUCCESS), 1 - general
      faillure (EXIT_FAILURE) 2 - no match (EXIT_NOMATCH).
  - names: [ '-F', '--file' ]
    help: |
      Path to the .list file to store the entry in. Works only with the
      `add` verb. Note that if a similar entry already exists (for
      example when just adding a component), or if the entry is present
      but disabled), the existing entry will be reused, modified and the
      file argument will be ignored.
  - names: [ '-D', '--disabled' ]
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Matches disabled (commented-out) entries.
  - names: [ '-E', '--enabled' ]
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Matches enabled entries.
  - names: [ '-I', '--invalid' ]
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Matches invalid entries.
  - names: [ '-a', '--architecture' ]
    action: append
    help: |
      Matches entries with the given architecture(s). May be specified
      multiple times.
  - names: [ '-c', '--component' ]
    action: append
    help: |
        Matches entries with the given component(s). May be specified
        multiple times.
  - names: [ '-d', '--distribution' ]
    help: |
      Matches the given distribution.
  - names: [ '-f', '--fuzzy' ]
    default: False
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Normally, whenever a list-based filter parameter is being
      evaluated, entries only match if they fulfill the specification
      completely. For example, when filtering using `--component main`,
      entries which possess the component `main` but also `contrib` will
      not match.

      By setting this flag, entries will match if *any* of the command
      line filter paramters will match.

      Applies only to: --architecture, --component.
  - names: [ '-r', '--regex' ]
    default: False
    action: store_true
    help: |
      --uri, --distribution and --component will now be evaluated as
      case-insensitive regular expressions against the entry.

      When used with `apply-template`, the behaviour of --component is
      different. Only the first occurrence of --component will be taken
      as the regex and only components matching that regex will be
      included in the final entry.
  - names: [ '-t', '--type' ]
    choices:
      - deb
      - deb-src
    help: |
      DEB source type.
  - names: [ '-u', '--uri' ]
    help: |
      Source URI.
  - names: [ '-s', '--simulate' ]
    default: False
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Do not save any changes, and log all changed source entries to
      stdout.
  - names: [ '-v', '--verbose' ]
    default: False
    action: store_true
    help: |
      Log program action to standard error, and log all changed source
      entries to standard output.
  - names: ['-T', '--template' ]
    help: |
      Derive all specifications from the given pyton-apt template. Only
      used by the apply-template action.
